# Customer Churn Prediction using XGBoost
This project uses the XGBoost algorithm to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company using the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or later
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, xgboost, and scikit-learn

## Installation
